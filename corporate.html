The "I" in the name is for INSPIRE as we want to motivate dog owners to begging the process and become concistant in preserving the bond with their dog. Last, but not least the "T" is for TEACH which is our main purpose to help dog owners train their dogs. </p>

          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>SIT dog training is an online platform providing people with accessible online training for big dogs. In the period between 19th of March and 16th of April we created and executed a creative marketing campaign. The campaign’s goal was to raise awareness to people about the existence of an easily accessible online dog training. We wanted to portray the brand as an understanding of the struggles dog owners face with disobedient pets and create a community around this struggle. SIT training offers people with various dog trainings focusing on obedience, and puppy training.  We executed the campaign on Instagram and TikTok. We want people to see us not only as people who would help them with train their pet companions, but also like a friend that understands their struggles in taking care of a big dog. 
For this marketing campaign we set up three different objectives. The first objective is to reach 1000 users by the 16th of April, measured through the accounts analytics. We want to reach 500 people on each platform. We will do this by posting regularly high quality visually appealing photos and videos of dogs who have behaved improperly. The reasoning behind this content types is to connect with the target audience on a deeper level and make them feel understood. Our second objective is to have at least 50content interactions weekly from our follower during the duration of the campaign, measured through account analytics such as . The content we would share on both platforms will be focused on making the target audience feel like there is a save space to communicate their struggles and reach out for help from our trainers. On TikTok we will post videos with trending sounds to showcase the playfulness of our trainers and some of the struggles. On Instagram we will share photos and videos of misbehaving dogs. Our third objective is to have 10% of our followers to feel supported and understood in the challenges they face with taking care of a big dog, measured through a poll on Instagram stories. The story will include a video of a destroyed pantry which is done by a dog. The question we will ask will be to see if they are also experiencing such troubles and to see if they feel understood. We want for our target audience to interact with the content we provide and in the end of the campaign to make them follow us and visit our website. We at SIT training want this campaign to showcase the friendly, helpful and joyful side of our brand and to inspire more big dog owners to sign up for a course.<br> 
During the campaign, we noticed that people interacted more with content where there was a dog rather than only people. This is why during the running time of our campaign we tried to post as much content as possible featuring our dog, Leo. The target audience found videos including Leo more interesting due to the relatable content we created with him. <br>
</p>
<p>For our first objective we observed that by the 16th of April we had achieved our goal as we managed to reach 769 account through our high visual posts and interesting and relatable videos. On TikTok, we had a reach of 625 people on our first post. Meaning, we had achieved our objective with the first post. However, the TikTok’s we uploaded did not so good as they only reached around 150 people each. We observed the difference in the posts such as the participants in the video itself and the hashtags used. In the first post we had a dog (Leo) and in the following ones it was just us doing trending challenges, which was not appealing to the target audience. In addition, we used #foryoupage for the first post which brought more people, and the second two posts did not have that hashtag which is a big part of the reason why we had reach fewer people in those posts.

For our second objective we wanted to have 150 interaction on Instagram and 50 on TikTok. On  TikTok we managed to have 78 like on our videos throughout the run time of our campaign and one person saved the video in their saves. For the Instagram in the same period we managed to have 131 interactions with all posts, reels and stories. We did not manage to achieve our objective in the specific number of interactions we wanted from each platform, but we have reached the set number of 200 interactions. During the campaign we could have changed the objective to a lesser amount of interactions on Instagram and a bigger number of interactions on TikTok, in order to successfully have achieved our objective. 
For our third objective we wanted to make 10% of our followers feel supported and understood in the challenges they face with taking care of a big dog. We measured this through a story poll on Instagram asking them if they can leave their dogs home alone. We received 48 responses with 60% of them being “Yes” and 40% of them being “No”. You can see the story we posted below. With the caption we tried to make the connection between us and our struggling followers who have to take care of a reckless big dog which might destroy furniture and toys. We this poll we wanted to show dog owners that we understand them and we have experienced the same situation as them and are here to help.</p>
